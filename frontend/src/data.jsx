        content: `In 1985-86, the Ministry of Welfare split into the Department of Women and Child Development and the 
                Department of Welfare, incorporating divisions from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Law. 
                Renamed as the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment in 1998, it further evolved with the formation 
                of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in 1999 and the separation of the Minorities Division and Wakf Unit in 
                2007. Despite disability being a state subject, the Indian government has been actively involved, operating 
                national institutes, regional centers, and funding NGOs for rehabilitation services. It is also committed 
                to international agreements like the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Acknowledging 
                the need for focused attention on disability issues, the government decided to establish a separate Department 
                of Disability Affairs within the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, a decision endorsed by the President 
                in March 2012. This move aims to enhance coordination with other ministries, align with international standards, 
                and address the diverse needs of persons with disabilities effectively.
